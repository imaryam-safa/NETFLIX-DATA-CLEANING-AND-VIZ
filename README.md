"# NETFLIX-DATA-CLEANING-AND-VIZ" 


I used the Netflix file from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ariyoomotade/netflix-data-cleaning-analysis-and-visualization). The raw version is available on the Kaggle. This is a the data on TV shows and movies uploaded to Netflix. 
First, I imported an Excel Workbook version of the file to Python and then cleaned it to remove nulls. 
Then saved a cleaned Excel Workbook, which I visualized using Power BI. 
I used charts like Key Influencers, and Drill Down of Genre from Countries to analyze data.
